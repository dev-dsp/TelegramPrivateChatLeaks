Search references
=================

Our task is find Telegram chats and groups which is available by links. Telegram links must be correct in order for it to be possible to go over it and get into Telegram. 

--------------
Type of links
--------------
Public link:

.. code::

    https://t.me/joinprivatechat

Private link direct to private or not private super group:

.. code::

    https://t.me/joinchat/Go8iLkIH8xamnPUyk7YPHQ

Private link direct to private or not private channel:

.. code::

    https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAErtjyk5AYzMvtiV2Q



Why "private or not private"?

Reason of this thing is not-expired private links which is generated before channel or group got public link. Yes private link working after that.




Also
""""""""""""
Private channels and groups have difference of generating link. The difference is different HASH after "/joinchat/". Channels has a "AAAAA" in front of HASH, and this helps to distinguish group from channel link.


----------
Web search
----------
World Wide Web has alot things.

Search sites and archives with files there is good stuff.

Join groups and channels and parse links. (Easy method might be automatized by bot)

================
Robotize process
================
Parsing in telegram can be automatized by bot, but this is not simple decision because bot with botAPI in telegram has no rights to join groups and chats. 

Solution is userbot. It is hard to put into practice because of Telegram limits.

Userbot is useful for dork finding and parsing.
